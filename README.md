**Description**: With the ever increasing size of data and complexity of methods required to analyze them, the reproducibility of results is necessary to ensure a high quality of scientific research. In this workshop, we will discuss the main concepts and motivations for reproducible research (RR). Mr. Bhatnagar will then introduce useful tools for RR, including [RStduio](http://www.rstudio.com/), [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). We will work through several examples to see how these tools can be used to perform efficiently common tasks such as writing reports, Beamer presentations, running simulations, repetitive function calls that require single or multiple inputs to be changed, and sharing results. Basic knowledge of `R` and `LaTeX` is assumed. 

Participants must bring their own laptops, with the following programs and packages installed:

* [R](http://cran.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio v0.99.441 Preview](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)
* `R` packages `knitr`, `magrittr`, `data.table`, `ggplot2`, `devtools`
* A working instance of `LaTeX`
* [TeXStudio (optional)](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/)
